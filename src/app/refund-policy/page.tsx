            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The most critical component of your MVP launch is predictability. This policy covers our core guarantee against internal delays.

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-blue-300">1. Guarantee Eligibility</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              This guarantee applies to all projects contracted under the <strong className="text-white">&quot;3-Stage Idea-to-Launch Velocity&quot;</strong> scope, where the project timeline and launch date are explicitly defined and agreed upon in the signed Scope of Work (SOW).

              <li className="ml-8">We will <strong className="text-white">pause all billing</strong> after the agreed-upon launch date.</li>
